            <h2>Lack of clarity : career goals</h2>
            <li>Many students choose Btech without a clear idea of their passion or carrer path</li>
            <li>They follow peer pressure or parental expectations instead of their true intrests</li>
            <li> Uncertainity about whether to take a job, pursue higher studies, or start a business leads to confusion</li>
            <li>Students should talk to mentors, seniors and professionals for guidance</li>
            <li>Research career options beyond traditional paths</li>
            <li>Identify your strengths and intrests by self-reflection and skill assessment</li>
            <li>Many colleges dont provide career counselling or mentorship programs to help students explore their intrests</li>
            <li>Many students only consider traditional paths like software jobs or government exams without exploring other possibilities</li>

                    <h2>Poor Time Management, Procrastination</h2>
                    <li>Many students waste crucial years by not managing time effectively</li>
                    <li>Procrastination in learning, completing projects, or preparing for placements leads to missed opportunities.</li>
                    <li> Last-minute studying affects academic performance and practical knowledge</li>

            <ul>
                <h2>Lack of practical skills & Industry Readiness</h2>
                <li>Many students focus only on textbook knowledge without gaining hands on experience</li>
                <li>Lack of internships, projects, coding skills( for CS students), or industry exposure reduces job opportunities</li>
                <li>Failure to adapt to new technologies and trends makes them less competitive</li>
                <li>For students in fields like Computer Science and Information Technology, there's often a gap between theoretical knowledge and practical coding skills.
                     Many students graduate without proficiency in industry-relevant programming languages or technical tools.</li>
                <li>The academic focus is often more on exams and theoretical assignments, leaving students with little opportunity to work on practical assignments or real-life problems.</li>
                <li>In many cases, the curriculum in engineering colleges can be outdated or not aligned with the current needs of the industry. 
                    This means students might not be learning the most relevant skills or technologies that are currently in demand.</li>
                    <li>Internships provide a great opportunity for students to gain hands-on experience and apply what they’ve learned in the classroom. However, many B.Tech students struggle
                         to secure quality internships or may end up doing ones that don't provide enough practical exposure.</li>
                <li>Many B.Tech students don't get enough exposure to the latest industry tools and technologies. The gap between what students learn in the classroom and what industries 
                    require can be vast, especially in fast-evolving fields like IT, AI, and robotics.</li>

        <h2>Fear of Failure & Low Self-Confidence</h2>
        <li>Fear of failure prevents students from taking risks, whether in entrepreneurship, interviews, or learning new skills</li>
        <li>Comparing themselves to others lowers conidence and increases self-doubt</li>
        <li>Many avoid opportunities because they think theu are "not good enough"</li>
        <li>High Expectations: B.Tech students are often under immense pressure to succeed, both from their families and themselves.
             The need to maintain high grades can lead to anxiety and a fear of disappointing others.</li>
        <li>Past Failures: A single failure can sometimes make students believe they’re 
            incapable of succeeding again, which can snowball into a fear of trying.</li>

                <li>Lack of networking and professional connections make it harder to find good opportunities</li>

            <li>Not seeking help for mental issues making worse over time</li>
            <li>Addressing poor mental health and improving stress management skills among B.Tech students requires a multifaceted approach, including mental health support, better time management, mindfulness techniques, physical well-being, and social support. Universities and colleges play a crucial role in creating an environment that encourages open conversations 
                about mental health, reduces stigma, and provides resources for students to manage stress.</li>
            <li>Join clubs or organizations: Encouraging students to get involved in extracurricular activities can help them build friendships and networks outside of academics.</li>
            <li>Adequate sleep: Poor sleep quality can exacerbate stress and mental health issues. Encourage students to adopt healthy sleep habits, such as 
                setting regular sleep schedules and reducing screen time before bed.</li>
