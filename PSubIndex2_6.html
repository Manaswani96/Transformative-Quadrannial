      A 4-year software development roadmap could include: Year 1: Foundational
      Skills and Project Experience, Year 2: Deepening Expertise and
      Specialization, Year 3: Leadership and Complex Project Management, Year 4:
      Advanced Technical Skills and Industry Impact with each year focusing on
      acquiring new technical skills, building a strong portfolio, and gradually
      taking on more leadership responsibilities within a chosen specialization
      area.

    <h2>Year 1: Foundational Skills and Project Experience</h2>
        Core Programming Languages: Mastering a primary programming language
        like Python, Java, JavaScript depending on your desired career path.
        Data Structures and Algorithms: Understanding fundamental data
        structures (arrays, linked lists, trees) and algorithms (sorting,
        searching) to solve problems efficiently.
        Front-End Development (if applicable): HTML, CSS, JavaScript frameworks
        (React, Angular, Vue) for building user interfaces.
        Back-End Development (if applicable): Database technologies (SQL,
        NoSQL), API design, backend frameworks (Node.js, Django, Spring Boot).
        Version Control: Git for managing code changes and collaboration.
        Project Development: Building small to medium-sized personal projects to
        apply learned concepts and showcase your skills.
