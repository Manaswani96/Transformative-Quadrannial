    Education and Early Life: Jan Koum was born in Ukraine in 1976, and his family emigrated to the United States when he was 16. They settled in Mountain View, California, where Koum faced a number of challenges, including financial difficulties. He was passionate about computers from an early age, learning how to program on his own. Despite not having a formal computer science education, he was self-taught and quickly became proficient.

    <p><strong>Struggles:</strong><br>
         Koum’s early life wasn’t easy. He grew up in a modest home, and his family had financial struggles. This didn’t deter him, though. He worked hard to teach himself programming and later worked as an engineer at Yahoo! for nearly a decade. Despite his success at Yahoo!, Koum was constantly driven by a vision of connecting the world, which ultimately led to the creation of WhatsApp.</p>

His passion was about making communication easy for everyone. His dedication to building something of value, rather than chasing money, drove him to keep going even when faced with obstacles.</p>

<strong>"The road to innovation is not paved with easy answers or formal degrees—it’s built on resilience, passion, and the willingness to learn from every mistake. Keep your vision clear, stay hungry for knowledge, and don't be afraid to challenge the status quo. The future belongs to those who dare to create." </strong><br>
