            <p><strong>Key Takeaways for B.Tech Students:</strong><br><br>
                

              <i>  <strong>Success Isn't About the Best University:</strong> Many successful entrepreneurs came from respected but not globally famous institutions. Success relies more on dedication and vision than the prestige of your alma mater.<br>
                
              <strong> Real-World Experience Over Degrees:</strong> Practical experience, building skills, and solving market problems often lead to success more than relying solely on degrees.<br>
                
            <strong>Passion Drives Innovation:</strong> Hard work, innovation, and risk-taking are often more important than formal education. Passionate students can turn ideas into successful businesses, regardless of where they studied.<br>
                
        <strong> Persistence Leads to Success:</strong> Overcoming challenges through persistence is key. These entrepreneurs prove that resilience is often the difference between failure and greatness.</p>
